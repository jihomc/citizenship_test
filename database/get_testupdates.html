        <p>On the naturalization test, some answers may change because of elections or appointments. As you study for the test, make sure that you know the most current answers to the following questions: 20, 23, 28, 29, 39, 40, 43, 46 and 47. Answer the questions regarding elected or appointed officials with the name of the official who is serving at the time of your naturalization interview with USCIS.</p>
        <p>* If you are 65 years old or older and have been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for 20 or more years, you may study just the questions that have been marked with an asterisk.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the lapse in federal funding, some official U.S. government websites may not be updated with the most recent information. Please check your official state government website for the name of your recently elected state officials.</p>
